Description: The purpose of this package is to facilitate the processing of get_draws for presentation, publication, and vetting usability. In contrast to get_outputs and get_pct_change, which return a 'mean' summary, get_draws return the mean of the 1000 change draws. By using get_draws we can conduct a variety of calculations and vet the meand draws.
